This was made to combat the issue of the [older bot](https://github.com/codesidian/Python-MissionChiefBot) being slow, and also difficult for users to install. Everything is there ready for the user at one click of a button.
Find the scan report of the exe [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/ODM5NDNhYjMzNjgwNjI0MDQ2ZDcwNTE4ODZkOTIzNjM6MTU4Nzc3NzYwMQ==/detection) incase you're worried it's a virus. 

## Features 
- Anti detection features, randomized timings with the ability to be set by the user for all tasks.
- Auto transport patients, and prisoners.
- Ability to complete alliance missions.
- Automatically despatches the closest units.
- Only sends the exact requirements, rather than leaving your missions incomplete.
- Send only a batch of missions at a time - set `missions_per_run ` to the amount required in your `config.ini`.
- Super fast, the bot is built with speed in mind! With the ability to despatch around 131 missions in around **6 minutes**.
- Multiple domains supported.
- Multiple accounts at one time, just create another bot in another folder and off you go.
- Transparent and legit development team.


## How to use
The bot currently is a paid bot only, free trials are available at my own discretion- you'll have to email or ask in Discord for that.

If you'd prefer to see a video tutorial you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9adxIIqONTw) or follow the below:

1. Download the code if you're a sponsor [here](https://github.com/jackbayliss/Mission-Chief-Bot/archive/master.zip) then extract the files to a folder of your choice (Just keep the files together)

2. Once done open the `config.ini` inside the config folder and replace corresponding `username` and `password` with your account information, and `server` with the country  your account is registered on such as `uk`. All working countries will be in the `server.ini`

`missions_per_run` is the amount of missions it will do per batch, so if it finds 100 missions and you've set it to 50 it will *ONLY* do 50. Set `show_own `to true if you want to ignore alliance missions, else set it to false.

### Main files
- MissionChiefBot - This is the main bot, this will run the despatching tasks etc.
- Restarter - This effectively is a cradle for the MissionChiefBot- if it major crashes (i.e exits) at all the bot will be auto restart. Usually good for people that want to run it while they're asleep etc.
- generate - This is in charge of grabbing new missions and the data, make sure you manually run this every time there's new missions.

## Premium 
The bot is no longer free- for the new version it's a 'pay what you can system'-  Everything is monitored via [the site](https://missionchiefbot.com) where you can manage, update and cancel your subscription at any time. This repo is generally for updates.

### Windows
Just double click the .exe and you're up and running!

### Linux
Please see the mac/linux branch [here](https://github.com/jackbayliss/Mission-Chief-Bot/tree/mac)

## Why is the source code hidden?
This is to mainly prevent the developers of the website seeing exactly how the bot is able to do it so quickly, this is more of a prolonging the life of the bot exercise.
